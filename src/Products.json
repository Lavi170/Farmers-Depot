      "harvest": "The processing tomatoes are checked for harvest by selecting a sample of tomatoes and counting the red-to-green ratio. This check helps to ensure that we are not harvesting too early or too late. Once we are satisfied with the ratio, we will send the harvesting crews out to use the mechanical tomato harvester. For fresh market tomatoes, we work with partners that will check the tomatoes for readiness. Once they are satisfied, a harvesting crew is sent out to hand pick the tomatoes and place them into a trailer to be shipped off. The fresh market tomatoes are much more sensitive than processing tomatoes and need to be handled with care. "
